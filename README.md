# SpaceTraders

## General presentation of the repository

This repository contains the code I’ll use to try out [SpaceTraders.io](https://spacetraders.io/).
Having read [the excellent Cosmic Python book](https://www.cosmicpython.com/) recently, my plan is to use this game as a testing ground for the principles of the book.

I’ll use Python exclusively.

## Contributing, PRs, licences, etc.

As this is a learning project for me, I’ll focus on coding everything here myself and won’t accept PR.
You are welcome to copy and use my code for whatever purpose you want.

## Structure of the repository

### Exploration folder

This folder will contain tutorial results and other temporary scripts. Basically this’ll be used as a training ground/API Exploration ground, before going on with a cleaner implementation.
